                        <p align="justify"> There are patterns in how people think, feel, and behave. Some people, for example, stay calm in most situations, while others get angry easily. Likewise, some people are curious to try new things, while others follow consistent paths. These patterns in characteristics which differentiates individuals indicates personality of a person. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> Personality is shown to influence work performance in different types of jobs such as management and healthcare. In contrast, influence of personality in software development, a human-centric activity, is relatively underexplored. </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                        This project aims at understanding the role of developer personality in software development, in relation to team performance and software productivity.

                        <p align="justify"> Software development is increasingly penetrating national and geographical boundaries. Today, people from different parts of the world, with different characteristics and backgrounds, collaborate online from different geographical locations to develop a software. This model of software development is called global software development.</p>
                        <p align="justify">
                        Many commercial and open source software projects these days are developed globally. Commercial projects, for example, adopt global software development for reasons such as skill-set unavailability and company acquisition. Open source software projects, on the other hand, flourishes by attracting participation worldwide. At a broader level, global software development is shown to improve both quantity and quality of software developed. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> There are, though, several challenges in global software development which arises due to the diversity in characteristics and background of developers, and global distribution of workforce. Incomplete information relating to a project among team members is one example of the challenges involved while working on a globally developed software project. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> This project aims at identifying missing opportunities in global software development for improvement.
                        <h4><b>Bias in Global Software Development</b></h4>
                        <p align="justify"> In traditional workplaces where people meet each other in-person for work, biases are known to exist, negatively influencing work performance and sense of equity among employees. In contrast, non-traditional workplaces such as online communities, where people may not meet in-person, are considered to provide a level-playing field for all. Open source software development, for instance, is described using phrases like ???code is king??? suggesting that only the quality of code matters for its inclusion in the main line of development. </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                        Lately, however, developers on code hosting platforms, such as GitHub and Bitbucket, are somewhat aware of the demographics of co-contributors. The increased awareness of individual characteristics, similar to traditional workplaces, creates a potential for bias. This sub-project analyzes open source software projects to understand reality and perceptions around the presence of geographical bias in GitHub. </p>
